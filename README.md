# Kadecot Extension for Snap!
This is server for Kadecot and Snap!

Kadecot(https://github.com/SonyCSL/KadecotCore) is android application.
And it is server for consumer electronics.

This is tiny script written in Python3.
It normalize JSON for Snap!(it is very havy task for Snap!) and send it to Snap!

I think,this is good start point for writing Snap! extension in Python3.
